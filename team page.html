                    <h3>Sara M</h3>
                    <p>Founder & Operations Lead – Connecting communities and managing supplier relations.<br><br>
                        With a background in supply chain logistics and a passion for 
                        sustainable development, she envisioned a platform that could bridge the gap between food surplus and food 
                        scarcity. After witnessing firsthand how much edible food was discarded daily by retailers, she set out to change
                         the system. At RescueMark, she oversees supplier relations, coordinates day-to-day operations, and works closely 
                         with community organizations to ensure rescued food is redirected effectively and safely. Her leadership style 
                         blends empathy, precision, and innovation — qualities that have shaped the team’s culture and mission. Outside 
                         of work, Sara advocates for food justice and volunteers at local community gardens.</p>

                    <h3>Thabo K</h3>
                    <p>Technical Lead – Builder of the RescueMark app and head of platform UX and infrastructure.<br><br>
                        Thabo is the architect of RescueMark’s digital engine. With over 10 years of experience in full-stack 
                        development and UX design, he specializes in building platforms that are intuitive, scalable, and inclusive. 
                        From designing the app interface to managing cloud infrastructure, Thabo ensures the RescueMark experience is 
                        smooth for users and seamless for partners. A self-proclaimed “tech for good” enthusiast, he believes that code 
                        should solve real-world problems — and RescueMark is his proudest application of that philosophy. Thabo also mentors 
                        youth in coding bootcamps across Gauteng and is known for turning late-night ideas into working prototypes by sunrise.</p>
